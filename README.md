# Wine Quality Prediction
 Kaggle’s Red Wine Quality dataset to build various classification models to predict whether a particular red wine is “good quality” or not. Each wine in this dataset is given a “quality” score between 0 and 10. For the purpose of this project, I converted the output to a binary output where each wine is either “good quality” (a score of 7 or higher) or not (a score below 7). The quality of a wine is determined by 11 input variables:

    Fixed acidity
    Volatile acidity
    Citric acid
    Residual sugar
    Chlorides
    Free sulfur dioxide
    Total sulfur dioxide
    Density
    pH
    Sulfates
    Alcohol
the 12th column display the quality of wine
    
      Wine Quality(0-10)
      
 Usage
  To run the wine quality prediction model, follow these steps:

      1.Ensure that you have set up the virtual environment and installed the required dependencies.
      2.Open the [main.py] file in your preferred Python IDE.
      3.Modify the file paths or any other parameters if necessary.
      4.Run the script, which will train the model using the provided training dataset and evaluate its performance on the testing dataset.
      5.Once the model has been trained, you can use it to predict the quality of new, unseen wines by providing the relevant input features.
